We are the **MATIS** group, and here there is our first project, we hope you will enjoy 😉



## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- First of all you need a unix operating system like : macOS or Linux.

- And that's all ! 


### Basic installation

You need at first to clone the project.

| Method         | Command                                                                                           |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **git clone**  | `git clone https://github.com/M4Hacker/c-environment`                                             |  


### Using the script

Well, after you clone the repo, **2 possibilities to run the script.**

### The easiest : 

Using Make file 
Once in the file c-environment 
You have to run this commmand :

`make build`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.

Now, to run the program you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`

And a list of 1 to 10 should appear !

Now, to clean up the file you have to run this command : 

`make clean`

And this is over 🎉

### The hardest : 

This is the manual execution
Once in the file **c-environment**
You have to run this command : 

`./setup.sh`

When it's done run this : 

`./build_program.sh`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.

Now, to run the program you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`

And a list of 1 to 10 should appear !

Now, to clean up the file you have to run this command : 

`./clean_repository.sh`

And this is over 🎉
