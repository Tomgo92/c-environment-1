We are the **MATIS** group, and here is our first project, we hope that you will enjoy 😉


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- First of all you need a unix operating system like : macOS or Linux.
- [Git](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/git) must be installed !
- That's all ! 

### Basic installation

At first, you need to clone the project.

| Method         | Command                                                                                           |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **git clone**  | `git clone https://github.com/M4Hacker/c-environment`                                             |  


### Using the script

Then, after you cloned the repo, there are **2 possibilities to run the script.**

### The easiest : 

Using Make file 
once you are in the c-environment repository, 
you have to use this commmand :

`make build`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.
Now, to run the program, you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`

A list of numbers from 1 to 10 should appear !
Now, to clean up the repository, you have to use this command : 

`make clean`

You're done 🎉

### The hardest : 

This is the manual execution,
once you are in the **c-environment** repository,
you have to use this command :

`./setup.sh`

When it's done run this : 

`./build_program.sh`

The file : **enumerate_numbers** has been created.
Now, to run the program, you have to use this command : 

`./enumerate_numbers`

A list of numbers from 1 to 10 should appear !
Now, to clean up the repository, you have to run this command : 

`./clean_repository.sh`

You're done 🎉
